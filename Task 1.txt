Difference between HTTP1.1 vs HTTP2?
HTTP1.1
#The client (browser) has to send a request to the server using the method (GET/POST).
#Server responds with the requested resource, for example – image, alongside the status of what it did to the client’s request.
#Keep in mind that this is not a one-time process. 
#Such requests and responses needs to be transferred between both these machines until the client receives all the resources, essential to load a web page on the end-user’s (your) screen.

HTTP2
#Protocol negotiation mechanism — protocol electing, eg. HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2 or other.
#High-level compatibility with HTTP/1.1 — methods, status codes, URIs and header fields.
#Page load speed improvements trough:
#Compression of request headers
#Binary protocol
#HTTP/2 Server Push
#Request multiplexing over a single TCP connection
#Request pipelining
#HOL blocking (Head-of-line) — Package blocking
